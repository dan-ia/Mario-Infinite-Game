### üìï About

M√°rio Infinity is a 2d game, which jumps over objects, with the aim of getting as far as possible.

It contains the original music while running, and when jumping and hitting an obstacle, the game's characteristic sounds are also played.

I left it at high speed and with obstacles at different speeds to make it more competitive.

#

### ‚ùì Why the app

Who has never had fun and/or been angry at a M√°rio game, right?

M√°rio Games have always been super nostalgic, and for that reason I had to create my M√°rio Infinity on the Web.
